# Definition.
Linear regression is a data analysis technique for predicting and modelling the relationship between a response dependent quantitative variable and either one independent variable (Simple linear regression) or several explanatory variables (multiple linear regression).

The main assumptions of the model are;

Linearity of two variables.

Normality of residuals.

Constant variability (homoscedasticity)

# About the project
